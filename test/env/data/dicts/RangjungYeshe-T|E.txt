re|noun + re + noun - Das: Under "re", 4) Occurs as a particle mostly put between two closely connected words for the purpose of giving the compound word a verbal signification; thus {snying rje} signifying compassion, can be split in two with the particle {re} between them and then it means: to take pity upon {snying re rje}; in the same manner {'o brgyal} fatigue becomes {'o re brgyal} = was fatigued. In like manner, we have {nyams re dga'}; {blo re bde}, [to be delighted]; {skyug re log}; {zhe re 'jigs}; {yi re mug}; {don re chung}. MSS: To this list we can add: {zhe re skyid}; {dang re spro}; {sems re skyo}, I'm feeling sad, how sad. [mss]
